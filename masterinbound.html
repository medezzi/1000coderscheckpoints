        <a href=""><img src="https://www.impactbnd.com/hubfs/video-marketing-workshop.png?t=1531888229075" width="600px" height="200px"></a>
        <p class="article-content">The past couple months have been very exciting for me at IMPACT as I transitioned to a new role of Account Supervisor. In addition to being the point person for a select few clients, I now manage a team of six Account Executives.  Without even realizing it, this new role and added responsibility has been something I've been working towards for a while now, all stemming to what I consider my passion in my career: helping people.  Though "helping people" is a super generic passion to claim, it's something that encompasses so many aspects of my life. But determining that passion, honestly, has not come easy... and that's OK. </p>

         <p class="article-content">Back in 2016, we designed a special hands-on training experience called the Video Marketing Workshop. Our goal was to help companies struggling with the learning curve that comes with Video Marketing and get on their way to making great visual content. The results of these workshops are pretty remarkable. In fact, you’d be surprised what is actually accomplished in 24-48 hours of hands-on learning. But why are they so special and what problems do they actually solve? Let’s talk about it.</p>

         <p class="article-content">Instagram seems to be pulling out all the stops when it comes to adding features and boosting engagement. And with good reason. Back in 2013, Snapchat added Stories and changed the way people could share their lives in a personal and not-so-permanent way. The only problem was, a handful of friends passively watching wasn’t enough to keep the lights on. Fast-forward a few years, the Snapchat Story hasn’t changed all that much and the app is quickly losing money and users.</p>

            <p class="text">As a digital marketer, you’re most likely spending a significant amount of time on your brand’s social media presence and following. This is especially true if you’re responding to questions and comments in real time, posting photos and live videos, or sharing new content to your audience (which you should). But let me ask you -- do you know if you’re actually gaining anything from your social media efforts? Unfortunately, you could be spending a considerable amount of time and money without breaking even if you’re not careful.</p>

            <p class="article-content">Throughout my school career, I must have taken about a dozen quizzes, tests, and assessments providing information on how I personally learn best. In fact, this topic fascinated me so much, I actually completed my college senior thesis on visual-spatial learning. But why is it so important to know how you learn best? Or have some insight into how your colleagues, clients, family, or friends learn? Your understanding of how you learn can impact your efficiency, motivation, attention span, memory, and more. It can also heavily affect the way you speak, read, and write throughout your personal and professional life.</p>
